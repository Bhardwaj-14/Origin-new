Ionization: Xenon gas is ionized, creating positively charged ions.\n2. Acceleration: The ions are accelerated through an electric grid, gaining high velocity.\n3. Neutralization: Electrons are added to the ions to neutralize their charge, creating a high-velocity exhaust.\n4. Thrust: The exhaust is expelled, producing a continuous thrust.\n\nIonic thrusters are highly efficient, but produce low thrust, making them suitable for long-duration space missions, Sir."

He is currently the CEO and CTO of SpaceX, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc., and founder of Neuralink and The Boring Company.\n\nElon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. He developed an interest in computing and programming at an early age and taught himself computer programming. He moved to Canada in 1992 to attend college and then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a degree in economics and physics.\n\nAfter college, Musk moved to California to pursue a career in technology and entrepreneurship. He co-founded his first company, Zip2, which provided online content publishing software for news organizations. In 1999, Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million.\n\nMusk's next venture was X.com, which later became PayPal. He co-founded the company in 1998 and served as its CEO until it was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002. Musk then went on to found SpaceX in 2002 with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and enabling the colonization of Mars.\n\nIn 2004, Musk co-founded Tesla, Inc., which has become one of the leading electric vehicle manufacturers in the world. He has also been involved in various other ventures, including Neuralink, which aims to integrate the human brain with computers, and The Boring Company, which seeks to reduce traffic congestion by building high-speed transportation systems.\n\nMusk is known for his ambitious goals and his ability to drive innovation and technological advancement. He has been named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine and has been recognized for his contributions to the fields of space exploration, electric vehicles, and renewable energy.\n\nSome of his notable achievements include:\n\n* Leading the development of the first privately funded liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit, the Falcon 1\n* Building the first privately funded company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station, the Dragon\n* Revolutionizing the electric vehicle industry with Tesla's Model S, Model X, and Model 3\n* Establishing SpaceX as a leading player in the commercial space industry\n* Making significant contributions to the development of solar energy and storage systems through SolarCity (acquired by Tesla in 2016)\n\nOverall, Elon Musk is a visionary entrepreneur and inventor who is pushing the boundaries of what is possible in technology and space"
